# Sign_Language_Detection_LSTM

A practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM NN built on TF Keras.

1. Extract MediaPipe Holistic Keypoints
2. Build a Sign Language model using a Action Detection powered by LSTM layers
3. Predict sign language in real time using video sequences
